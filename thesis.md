## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a stress-relief machine that converts the mechanical energy generated by punching a bag into electrical energy. The primary aim of this system is to offer a unique, interactive way for users to relieve stress while simultaneously harnessing energy that would otherwise dissipate. Using piezoelectric sensors embedded within the punching bag, the machine captures energy from each punch and transforms it into electrical energy. This energy is not only stored but also continuously monitored, logged, and analyzed to provide real-time feedback to the user. Additionally, the machine tracks various metrics, including punch force and frequency, to create a comprehensive picture of user interaction.

## Objectives
- **Stress Relief**: Release of stress or any other emotions from the user.
- **Energy Harvesting**: Capture and store mechanical energy generated by punches.
- **Data Visualization**: Use the Raspberry Pi 4 to manage data and provide real-time visual feedback to the user.
- **User Interaction**: Provide insights on punch scores and energy generated, as well as pre-test and post-test metrics to assess effectiveness.

## System Architecture
- **Mechanical Energy Conversion**: Piezoelectric sensors convert mechanical force into electrical signals.
- **Data Management**: 
    - **Raspberry Pi 4** handles data visualization and user interface.
    - **Arduino Uno** manages sensor interfacing and logic control.
- **Storage**: Punch data, energy harvested, user demographics, and pre-test/post-test results are stored on an SD card attached to the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino Uno, Piezoelectric Sensors, AC-DC Converter
- **Software**: Python with PyQt5 (for data visualization), Arduino IDE
- **Data Storage**: SD card on Raspberry Pi

## Methods
The stress-relief machine operates by capturing the mechanical force exerted by users as they punch the bag, converting this force into electrical energy through the piezoelectric sensors embedded in the bag. Each punch generates an electric charge proportional to the mechanical force, which is detected and pre-processed by the Arduino Uno. This pre-processing includes filtering noise and amplifying the signal to ensure accuracy before the data is sent to the Raspberry Pi for further handling. On the Raspberry Pi, the data is logged, stored, and then visualized in real time.

The real-time visualization is achieved using a graphical interface developed with Pythonâ€™s PyQt5 library, allowing users to see their punch scores and energy generation metrics as they interact with the machine. This immediate feedback is designed to enhance user experience by providing continuous updates on their performance and progress. The visualization interface also includes options for pre-test and post-test assessments, where users can compare their metrics before and after each session to gauge improvement over time.

## Key Features
1. **Punch Energy Conversion**: Converts mechanical energy from each punch into electrical energy using piezoelectric sensors.
2. **Data Logging**: Stores punch scores, energy generated, and user demographics.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Visualizes data on the Raspberry Pi display, allowing users to track their performance and energy output.
4. **User Test Comparisons**: Provides pre-test and post-test assessments to gauge user improvement over time.

## Results
Initial results indicate that the stress-relief machine effectively captures and records data from each punch, allowing for detailed analysis of punch force, frequency, and total energy output. The real-time visualization provides users with an intuitive understanding of their performance, encouraging continued use and engagement with the machine. Analysis of pre-test and post-test data shows measurable improvements in user performance over time, suggesting that the system not only aids in stress relief but also enhances user strength and consistency.

User testing demonstrates that the machine is successful in offering a unique, interactive form of stress management, where users can visibly track their exertion and energy output. By combining physical activity with measurable feedback, the machine provides a rewarding experience that encourages repeated use, ultimately contributing to long-term stress management.
