<p>A bit of context for this project:
This is a bootcamp project that we had back in college. It is a requirement in order to receive a blockchain developer certificate from the bootcamp organizers, The Blokc, which is a blockchain organization here in the Philippines.</p>

<p><img src="images/cert.jpg" alt="Certificate" /></p>

<p>I initially couldn’t think mof anything as a topic for a project so I just randomized it. Knowing that, I also was an avid listener of Hev Avi, a filipino rapper which is trending that time, and I found the thought of making the webpage and the token all about Hev Abi to be funny. And so I went with it.</p>
