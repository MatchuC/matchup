    <h1 id="things-about-me">Things About Me!</h1>

<p>I am a graduate of Computer Engineering, driven by a deep passion for all things tech! From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by the inner workings of computers and how they shape our world. My journey has led me to explore various domains within IT, and I thrive on the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.</p>

<p>During my college internship, I had the incredible opportunity to delve into the world of computer networking. This experience not only deepened my understanding of network architecture and protocols but also ignited my enthusiasm for exploring the vast area of networking. Working alongside industry professionals, I gained hands-on experience that has shaped my approach to problem-solving in the tech landscape.</p>

<p>Below are some of the exciting projects I’ve developed, each reflecting my skills, creativity, and commitment to innovation. I invite you to explore these projects and discover my journey in the ever-evolving tech landscape!</p>
