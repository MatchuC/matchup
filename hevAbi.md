# HevAbi Coin

A bit of context for this project:
This is a bootcamp project that we had back in college. It is a requirement in order to receive a blockchain developer certificate from the bootcamp organizers, The Blokc, which is a blockchain organization here in the Philippines. 

I initially couldn't think mof anything as a topic for a project so I just randomized it. Knowing that, I also was an avid listener of Hev Avi, a filipino rapper which is trending that time, and I found the thought of making the webpage and the token all about Hev Abi to be funny. And so I went with it.

So, this is a web-based application for minting, staking, and withdrawing ERC-20 tokens. This project leverages **smart contracts** and is built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Solidity**.

## Features
- **Minting**: Users can mint their own tokens.
- **Staking**: Stake tokens to earn rewards.
- **Withdrawal**: Securely withdraw tokens.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Solidity, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS, Web3.js
- **Tools**: MetaMask, Ganache
